CoDec Research
==============

This folder contains research-related code for the NYU-TRI collaboration project on machine-teaching in human driving.


## Directory Structure

The root contains two direcoties:
1. **code**: Contains all the research code
2. **results**: Contains the results of various analyses. This directory also stores temporary files generated by the code (but are ignored during git push).



### code

This derectory cotains all the research-specific code, organized into directories by the functions they perform. Directories begining with 'Exp-' contain the highest level of code which calls functions from other scripts 


### resutls

This directory contains final analysis resuts which are submitted for publication ([analysis_results](./results/analysis_results/)). The [simulation_results](./results/simulation_results/) folder is used for storing teporary files generated by the code during runtime, and is included in the gitignore list.
